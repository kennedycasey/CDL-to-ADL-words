# CDL-to-ADL-words

This repository contains anonymized data and analysis scripts for a project investigating English-speaking children's and their caregivers' shift from producing words that are more associated with child-directed language (CDL) to words that are more associated with adult-directed language (ADL).

Corpus analyses are based on two datasets: CHILDES and the Language Development Project ([LDP](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-23792-001)). The LDP is not yet publicly available. Corpus analyses can be run without this dataset by setting `ldp.access <- FALSE`.
